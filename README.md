# Resistance-Network-Calculator
This Python program selects 1-3 resistors from a given list to form a two-terminal network, aiming to match a user-specified resistance value.Users can define resistor values via CSV files, set the number of resistors, specify tolerance, and choose if each resistor can only be used once.
